# CauzziMusic

In the past few weeks I decided to mix two of my favorite hobbies together, music and coding, in a single Project. I created a music app in React Native for personal use (and for some friends too) that I kindly named “Cauzzi Music”. A very challenging project that I used as a way to practice my own knowledge and as a reason to study more of React Native. I’m very proud of this app, because it won't be just a random project that I will forget when it's done, but something that I actually will be using in my day-to-day life.

This is one of the benefits of studying how to code. To have the power to create a tool with your own hands exactly the way you want it without having to depend on others to do that. To be able to feel this incredible feeling of knowing that the app that you frequently use was created by your own effort and dedication.

React is a Javascript framework for frontend development. It allows us to create modern and optimized web interfaces concisely and easly. React Native applies the same principles to develop mobile apps for iOS and Android.
